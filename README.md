# Mini-Project
This project was implemented using C++, utilizing data algorithms, for processing and analysis, with dataset loading from CSV files into vectors for efficient evaluation
This project primarily focuses on analyzing electric vehicle data from Washington State to evaluate the environmental sustainability of different electric vehicle models. By utilizing specific attributes including make, model, clean alternative fuel eligibility and electric rage, it could be noted which vehicles are more environmentally friendly. Additionally, it involves the loading and processing of data using algorithms and coding in C++. The key outcomes include the average electric range for specific make and model combinations, which make, and model produces the highest average electric range and which electric vehicle types, and model year produces the most clean alternative fuel vehicles. This analysis helps consumers understand which vehicles are more environmentally friendly and manufacturers to improve sustainability on their future vehicles.
Key Achievements:
•	Developed algorithms to load and process CSV data into structured formats.
•	Calculated average electric ranges and identified ideal vehicle choices for a better environment.
•	Identified trends in electric vehicle types and model years that maximize sustainability and not compromise the environment.
Moreover, this project demonstrates how data insights can improve consumer choices and promote sustainability within the electric vehicle industry.
